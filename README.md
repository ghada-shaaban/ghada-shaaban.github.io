## About Me
Egyptian-born, Sweden-shaped designer turned Product Manager, bringing an urban design and architecture mindset into digital product development. With an MSc in urban design, Iâ€™ve designed and shaped spatial strategies in Portugal and co-created circular systems in Mexico. That path across cultures and scales has taught me to transform ambiguity into clarity, and vision into action, especially where place, policy, and people intersect.
