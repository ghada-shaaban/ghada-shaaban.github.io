## About Me
Egyptian-born, Sweden-shaped designer turned Product Manager, bringing an urban design and architecture mindset into digital product development. With an MSc in urban design, I’ve designed and shaped spatial strategies in Portugal and co-created circular systems in Mexico. That path across cultures and scales has taught me to transform ambiguity into clarity, and vision into action, especially where place, policy, and people intersect.

If you're curious about building better tools, ecosystems, or sustainability-driven platforms, I’d love to connect and I'm always up for a good chat or collaboration.
